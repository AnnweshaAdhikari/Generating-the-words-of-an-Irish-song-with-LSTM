# Generating-the-words-of-an-Irish-song-with-LSTM
Generating the words of an Irish song with LSTM

Overview
This project demonstrates how to generate the lyrics of an Irish song using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. LSTM networks are well-suited for sequence prediction problems, such as text generation, where the goal is to predict the next word in a sequence based on the words that came before it.

By training the LSTM model on a corpus of Irish song lyrics, the model learns the patterns, style, and structure of the language, allowing it to generate new, coherent lyrics in the style of traditional Irish songs.

Project Structure
Data Collection and Preprocessing: 

Dataset: A collection of Irish song lyrics is used as the training data. This dataset can be compiled from publicly available sources of traditional Irish songs.
Text Preprocessing: The lyrics are cleaned and processed to create sequences of words that the LSTM model will use to learn and generate new lyrics.
Model Development:

The model is built using the Keras library with TensorFlow as the backend.
Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size, which are then fed into the LSTM layers.
LSTM Layers: Multiple LSTM layers are used to capture the sequential dependencies in the lyrics.
Dense Layer: The final layer predicts the next word in the sequence, given the input sequence of words.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The model is trained using a categorical cross-entropy loss function, appropriate for multi-class classification tasks where the goal is to predict the next word from a vocabulary of possible words.
The model's performance is evaluated by generating new lyrics after training, and qualitative analysis is performed to assess the coherence and style of the generated text.
Text Generation:

After training, the model can be used to generate new lyrics by providing a seed sequence of words and letting the model predict the subsequent words.
The generated lyrics can then be adjusted or refined to create complete verses or entire songs.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: TensorFlow (with Keras), Pandas, Numpy

Dataset
A collection of Irish song lyrics is required for training the model. The dataset should be in plain text format, with lyrics separated by newline characters.
